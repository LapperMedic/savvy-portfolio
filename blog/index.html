            Welcome to my fantastic blogablog, the world's first blog to ever be created in the interwobs. On a cold October morn in 1917, a young lad named Vladimir stood up and established the first blog, which at that time was called a "electromechanical hydraulic memoir machine". Of course at the time, there was nothing for this hydraulic creation to be run on, so it was simply printed off using the still-novel concept of movable type. And that's where we connect with the modern day.
